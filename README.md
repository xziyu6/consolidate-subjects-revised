# Consolidate Subjects (Revised)

Revised version of [Consolidate Subjects](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3275638709)

## Changes Made
- Adds the additional primary cultures of target subject to the recipient
- Only selects the first valid recipient (no more multiple recipients in the tooltip)
- Allows consolidation of colonies and crown lands
- Added localization for all other languages (AI generated)

## Original mod

Adds a new Subject Action that causes a target subject to be annexed by a neighboring subject of the same culture.

Target Subject must be:
Not a Player
Country Tier < Kingdom (Pan-Nationalism unlocks consolidating Kingdom-tier vassals)
A Puppet or a Vassal
Liberty Desire < 25

The neighboring subject must be a Puppet or Vassal with < 50 Liberty Desire, and must share at least one primary culture with the target subject.

With Pan-Nationalism and Civilizing Mission researched, you can consolidate similar-culture subjects: All the subject's primary cultures must share a trait with a receiving subject's primary culture, and must be at least Second-Class Citizen status.

AI will consolidate its subjects when able.
